# Dart reduce() Empty List Error

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty list. The `reduce()` method throws an `UnsupportedError` if the list is empty, which can lead to unexpected application crashes.  This example shows how to mitigate this by checking for emptiness before calling `reduce()`.
